                <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
             My name is <b>Carl Cedrick Pascua</b>, and I am an aspiring software engineer currently pursuing my studies at the National College of Science and Technology. I have always been deeply passionate about using technology as a powerful tool to drive development and address significant, real-world challenges. With a solid educational foundation in computers, I have developed a strong aptitude for problem-solving, which has fueled my desire to create innovative solutions through coding and software development.
            </p>
            <p>
           Currently, I am focused on learning and mastering several programming languages, including C++, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as I believe these are crucial for building versatile, dynamic applications. I thrive in fast-paced, dynamic environments where I can continuously improve my skills, collaborate with others, and push the boundaries of my knowledge in software development. My goal is to not only enhance my technical expertise but also to contribute meaningfully to the field by developing cutting-edge software that makes a positive impact on society.
